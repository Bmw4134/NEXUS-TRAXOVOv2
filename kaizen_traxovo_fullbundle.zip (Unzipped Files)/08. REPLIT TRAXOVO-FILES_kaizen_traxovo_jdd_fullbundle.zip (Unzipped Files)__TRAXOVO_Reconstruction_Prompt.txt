- Do not reset memory or destructively rewrite dashboards.

Enhancements:

- Activate diff_watcher, session monitor, and data confidence validators.
- Enable real-time fleet + job zone predictive overlays.
- Validate GroundWorks integration (if NDA complete).
- Re-link legacy driverâ€“asset mapping matrix for job overlap detection.
- Test against all known past regressions.
- Output LIVE_READY = true only if no failure paths are detected.
